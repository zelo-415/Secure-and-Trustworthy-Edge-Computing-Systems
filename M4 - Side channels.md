side channels:
the **unintentional leakage of information via observed signals and behavior**, from existing execution.

physical and digital side-channels

physical: nearby

toolbox:
- time domain
- freq domain
- intermediate
- more data!

differential analysis: a peak if correlated

Template attack:
more advanced than diff: using like ML to build a template(distribution)

EM eye

###### how to defend
physical: shielding, random, air gap
digital: isolation, random...

###### good things
anomaly detection
